# Data-Structures-And-Algorithm

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/63b1e3a050eb4e6bb1c7c0862480b5cb)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/rudrakshi99/Data-Structures-And-Algorithm?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=rudrakshi99/Data-Structures-And-Algorithm&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer. I made this repository to practice how to correctly implement common data structures and algorithms in the simplest and most elegant ways.
